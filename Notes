Release 2 notes: 
Support for multiple concurrent clients that includes
    - socketserver lib based server code that handles multiple client requests simultaneously
    - For simplicity I have used source port of the incoming client as an identifier. Each client has independent dataset file
    - Client profiles are stored in JSON  file. Each profile has the following fields: (port#, name, dataset file name)
    - Modified test clients to send arbitrary samples tuples 
    - Tested up to 5 simultaneous clients 

2. Rudimentary Rest API that returns mean, standard deviation and epsilon for each connected client.
    -  A client dictionary is created with port as index. Dictionary is converted to xml before sending over REST i/f

Added some (but not enough) exception handling and traces.


Release 1 Notes:

This is a quick and dirty prototype for machine learning based fog gw application written in python.


Fog gateway:
1.  Fog gateway uses samples collected a-priori (dataset1) to “learn" about baseline normal.
    dataset1 is 317x2 matrix, where each row represents a sample in the form [throughput, latency]

2. Fog gateway uses multivariate gaussian distrubution to fit the dataset1. It determines mean and 
   variance of dataset1. For simplicity, it picks epsilon heuristically though it could be determined
   algorithmically as well.

3. After this, fog gateway goes into listening mode, where it receives samples from a client application over 
   a simple socket interface. On receiving a sample, the gateway applies anomaly detection algorithm to determine
   if the sample is anomalous or not. It prints message on the console, if so.


Fog node:
1. Fog client use dataset2 Fog clients send periodic 2D samples as: [throughput, latency]
2. samples are serialized and deserialized before sending to the server for processing. I used pickles to
   do so, but ideally it should be JSON or something equivalent.
3. In order to avoid overwhelming server, samples are sent every 50msec.

Connectivity is as follows:

[fog-node.py]----socket interface-----[fog-gw.py]

Caveats: 
It’s working code, but some of the libraries work only with python 3.3. So a part of the scripts would require that.
datasets are provided publicly, courtesy Andrew NG 
I have borrowed concepts from various online resources, but have not copied code
The code is rudimentary (meaning no exception handling, error handling etc.)
I am a beginner in python, so be nice to me!
